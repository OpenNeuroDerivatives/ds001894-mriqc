    "TaskDescription": "Subjects were presented with two monosyllabic English words and asked to make a rhyming judgement. Word pairs were categorized into four conditions: 24 pairs were orthographically similar and phonologically similar (O+P+), 24 pairs were orthographically different and phonologically similar (O-P+), 24 pairs were orthographically similar and phonologically different (O+P-), and 24 pairs were orthographically different and phonologically different (O-P-). The first word was presented auditorily along with a black fixation cross for 800 ms followed by a 200 ms interstimulus interval and then by the second word presented visually for 800ms. Length of auditory stimuli can be found in /stimuli/WordAudDuration.tsv. The second stimulus was followed by a red fixation cross lasting 2200-3000 ms. Participants could respond as soon as the second word was presented until the beginning of the next trial. 24 perceptual trials were included involving matching judgements of non-alphabetic glyphs. The glyphs were presented as increasing, decreasing, or steady in height. Subjects were asked to report whether the two presented stimuli matched or did not. 48 control trials were included to account for motor responses. In these trials a black cross was presented instead of words or symbols and a blue cross was presented instead of a red fixation cross. The timing for the fixation and perceptual trials was the same as for the lexical trials. Stimulus order was counterbalanced across participants. This yielded 168 trials. Trials were pseudo-randomized using opt-seq2 software and divided into two separate 84 trial runs titled task-AVWord_run-01 and task-AVWord_run-02.",
